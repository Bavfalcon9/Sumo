# Notice
I spent days trying to figure out how i wanted to structure this because I was trying to be perfect, however after a few days I decided I needed to put something together and get this out. This solution is temporary considering i will still want to maintain the plugin. I will continue to brainstorm how i want to handle games, etc, but i think it's important to note that how I made this work isn't exactly the preferred method.

# To Do
- Replace the hard written errors with a `messages.yml`
- Bind the listener to the game itself.
